The Biophilia Educational Program is designed to inspire children to explore their own creativity, and to learn about music and science through new technologies. We were asked by Björk’s label, One Little Indian, to execute the designs on a robust platform that would stand up to intense traffic spikes.

In this case, we worked from approved designs and ensured these rendered perfectly cross-browser. The site's content is divided up according to its audience - for the public, for educators, and for the press, and includes a vast array of videos, images and teaching materials.

Biophilia Educational has been in full swing for over 2 years now and continues to be a great success with children and adults alike as the workshops tour all over the world.
