Whilst working at Messum’s Fine Art in London for my industrial placement I was privileged to be involved in an extensive review of the company’s online and digital assets. Following a complete overhaul of the CRM and CMS solutions I was tasked, along with a fellow developer, with redesigning the company’s website.

The new website was required not simply to keep up appearances, but also to cope with Messum’s desire to embrace the possibilities that today’s web has to offer— an ethos the company values highly. Our brief was to rethink the website from every angle, from the underlying data and how it was accessed, through to the user experience and visual appearance of the site.
