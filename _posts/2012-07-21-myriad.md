Myriad is a film and research company made up of visual anthropologists. They offer distribution and representation to filmmakers, often focusing on ethnographic issues. They needed a website that could be used both as a means of marketing themselves to budding filmmakers and to stream the videos published in their network.

The site was developed from an existing design, and I was presented with the challenge of providing a robust and scalable solution that facilitated pay-per-view streaming. Furthermore, the site had to be viewable in both English and Danish.

>James has been a pleasure to work with and on hand to ensure that the final product is up to scratch. He has been a great value option providing everything we needed while working to budget and ensuring a high level of personal contact throughout.
