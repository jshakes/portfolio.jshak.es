Made in Brunel is the annual showcase of work from Brunel University’s School of Engineering and Design. Each year, final year students are given the freedom and means to make the show unique to their year, with total organisational control. For 2011, Made in Brunel felt a fresh online presence was needed.

The website needed to carry the well established Made in Brunel brand and convey the values associated with it, namely a focus on the people behind the show. As head of the web team I was responsible for producing a final design for the site, then leading a team of several other developers in the construction of the site. Further development of the site included the addition of ‘People’ and ‘Projects’ sections which detailed every exhibitor and exhibit found at Made in Brunel 2011.

Working with a dedicated team of product and multimedia designers, we have crafted a website that has received great acclaim both within and beyond the university.

> James is not only incredibly technically skilled, but also a real pleasure to work with. He is the sort of person you always want to have working on your projects, whether that be as part of the team delivering or as the professional you hire to turn your rough ideas into reality.
