Cash Converters are the UK and Australia’s largest retailer of second hand goods, with 200 high street stores in the UK and 250 in Australia, as well as offering a range of financial service. Their corporate site needed to present users with clear, concise information about the services they offered to customers as well as franchisees and investors. 

Key features of the site are numerous - store locator, financial services (including pawn-broking, payday loans, cheque cashing and buy-backs), franchisee recruitment – as well as significant e-commerce functionality to facilitate online sales. Cash Converters have over 1 million unique second-hand products in their stores throughout the UK - and this catalogue of products changes on a daily basis. A sophisticated webshop offering online listings and auctions was developed, which allowed all sales to be managed in a bespoke admin area, from uploading items to automated reconciliation. This was also integrated into the Cash Converters stock control system.
