Clare Price is a South London-based artist producing powerful, vibrant works on canvas using a variety of media. Her site design needed to take a back-seat to the extroverted nature of the content, with ease-of-navigation and presentation being of primary concern.

The design chosen was intentionally understated, showcasing the artist and her work as opposed to flashy graphics and layout gimmicks. jQuery was used to employ a one-page navigation that loaded content via AJAX, making for a more fluid user-experience.
