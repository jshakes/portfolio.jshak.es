Tech City Investment Organisation is the arm of the UK government tasked with cultivating growth in East London’s ‘Silicon Roundabout’ tech community. Whilst at Traffic Digital I was responsible for developing the underlying Wordpress structure of their new website.

TCIO is a well-established presence on the London startup scene so we knew a lot of tech-savvy eyes would be on the site from the moment it launched. As such we had to pull out all the stops to deliver a beautiful, responsive, secure and technically exciting website.
