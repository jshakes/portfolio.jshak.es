Time Warner is the holding company behind some of the most popular TV shows and in movies going, so in redesigning their corporate site we had a wealth of rich images and assets to work with. Their homepage was a good chance to showcase these assets alongside content relevant to investors and job-hunters, and we did so using an innovative tile system that literally split the page open to reveal video content behind the artwork.
