Paste Up is a web content management system that gives the owners of small websites the tools they need to have full control of their online content. By employing an intuitive ‘click to edit’ interface, users can arrange text, images and media within the web page itself.

The project was undertaken as part of my final year at Brunel University. The aim of the project was to create a content management system that placed a focus on visual editing through an intuitive interface. Alongside a working prototype I also produced a huge body of research, design and development work, exploring primarily the perceptions of editing web content amongst my target audience.
